# Understanding Q, K, V in Self-Attention

## 1. Big Picture — What Self-Attention Does
Self-attention allows each token (word) in a sequence to focus on other tokens when creating its new representation.  
For example, when processing "cat" in the sentence *"The cat sat on the mat"*, the model might look at "sat" and "mat" for context.

## 2. Why 3 Different Matrices (Q, K, V)

| Matrix | Role | Analogy |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Q** (Query) | What am I *looking for*? | Like a search request in a search engine |
| **K** (Key)   | What do I *offer*?       | Like the metadata/tag describing an item |
| **V** (Value) | What information do I *return*? | Like the full content of the item |

**Reason:** Q–K matching finds relevant context, and V carries the actual content.

## 3. Tiny Numerical Example

Example with two tokens and 2D vectors:

```
"cat" → [1, 0]
"sat" → [0, 1]
```

Weight matrices:

```
W_Q = [[1, 0],
       [0, 1]]

W_K = [[0, 1],
       [1, 0]]

W_V = [[1, 2],
       [0, 3]]
```

Steps:
1. Create Q, K, V by multiplying embeddings by their respective weight matrices.
2. Compute attention scores via Q·K.
3. Apply softmax to get attention weights.
4. Weighted sum of V to produce output.

## 4. Database Analogy

| Database Search Engine | Transformer Self-Attention |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Query: Search term     | Query: Current token’s Q vector |
| Key: Metadata          | Key: Token’s K vector |
| Value: Item content    | Value: Token’s V vector |
| Compare Q with all Ks to rank items | Compare Q with all Ks to weight tokens |
| Return matching items’ Values | Weighted sum of Values → new representation |

## 5. Why Not Just Q and V?

If we skip **K** and compute attention as Q·V:
- **V** is optimized for content, not matching → matching becomes noisy and scale-sensitive.
- K provides a *matching space* independent from content, allowing better control and stability.

**Analogy:**  
In a library:
- Q = question
- K = catalog card
- V = full book

Searching directly in full books (V) is inefficient and error-prone.

## 6. Numeric Example: Q–K–V vs Q–V

**Q–K–V (Good)**:
- Q·K computes semantic similarity.
- V is used only for blending content.

**Q–V (Problem)**:
- Large values in V dominate attention regardless of meaning.
- Attention weights become unstable.

## 7. Conclusion
Separating Q, K, V:
- Keeps **matching** (Q–K) and **content mixing** (V) independent.
- Comes from information retrieval principles used in databases and search engines.
- Allows the model to learn optimized spaces for each step.
